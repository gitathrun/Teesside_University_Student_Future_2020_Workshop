## About Student Future Events ##

Student Futures is a school wide yearly event in Teesside University. Each department of the school is running its own version. Dr Myriam Mallet is responsible for organising the event for the CSIS (Computer Science and Information Systems) department in 2020. This year's plan is to offer workshops led by industry to students. There will be several workshops running in parallel i.e. one for CS students, one for CyberSecurity students and one for Web and IT students.
