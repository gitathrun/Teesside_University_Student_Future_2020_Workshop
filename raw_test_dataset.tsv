aadhith	This is a film well worth seeing, talking and singing heads and all.
didion	<>Light , cute and    forgettable .
dieks	Like &*Mike does n't win    any points for originality .
lodis	Far from perfect , but its heart     is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning .
opportina	The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
oprisan	I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it , but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .
sendy	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
sequioa	In a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel .
seref	A romantic comedy that operates     by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
serghe	Run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
ivaila	Merely as a technical , logistical    feat , Russian Ark marks a cinematic milestone .
hamaz	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
gwyn	Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly     paced to be a thriller . 
goodspeed	Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
godehart	This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make Jay and Silent Bob 's Excellent Adventure seem understated .
